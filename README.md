# Real-Time-Chat-Application with Socket.IO

This repository contains the code for a **comprehensive, full-stack chat application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project stands out as an **advanced chat app tutorial**, demonstrating robust real-time communication capabilities facilitated by **Socket.IO**.

## **Key Features and Technologies:**

*   **MERN Stack Core**:
    *   **MongoDB**: Utilised as the NoSQL database for **persistent storage of all chat, message, and user data**.
    *   **Express.js**: A flexible Node.js web application framework handling the backend logic and API routing.
    *   **React.js**: Powers the dynamic and responsive user interface on the frontend.
    *   **Node.js**: The backend JavaScript runtime environment and scalable web server.
*   **Real-time Communication**:
    *   **Socket.IO Integration**: Enables **instant message delivery** and a **typing indicator** that appears and disappears as users type, providing a seamless real-time experience.
*   **Messaging Functionality**:
    *   Supports both **one-on-one messaging** and **group messaging**, a differentiating feature compared to other tutorials.
    *   Users can send **emojis** in messages.
    *   **Persistent messages**: All chat history is stored in the database and remains available across user sessions.
*   **User Management & Security**:
    *   **User Registration**: Includes features like choosing a profile picture, a loading animation during signup, and a "show/hide" option for the password field.
    *   **Password Encryption**: User passwords are **encrypted using bcrypt** before being stored in the MongoDB database, ensuring security.
    *   Profile pictures are stored using Cloudinary.
*   **Group Chat Administration**:
    *   Group chat administrators have specific **authorisation** to **change the group name** and **add or remove users** from the group.
*   **User Experience Enhancements**:
    *   **Notification Indicator**: Users receive a visual notification when new messages arrive while they are not actively on the chat screen. Clicking this redirects them to the relevant chat.
    *   Ability to search for other users and view user profiles.

This project is ideal for those looking to build a robust MERN stack application with advanced real-time features. While the tutorial is comprehensive, basic JavaScript knowledge is the only prerequisite.
